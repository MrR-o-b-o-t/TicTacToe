## Summary

One of my first projects built without the aid of tutorials or walkthroughs. This is an early project where I wanted to build something that would
allow me to solidify basic JavaScript, HTML5 and CSS3 concepts. It was a blast building and even led me to a great local programming community that I now
meet with on a regular basis.
